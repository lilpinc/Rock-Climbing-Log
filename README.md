# Rock-Climbing-Log

## Description

An app where you can log your outdoor sends and training sessions so you can track your progress besting rocks.

## Motivation

This app was made as a place for users to record and update their training/climbing sessions and outdoor climbing achievments. It was created because of my personal love for climbing and exercise, as well as quality practice utilizing graphql, mongoDB, and React to create a functional website.

## Usage

This app can be used to record and update your own climbs and training sessions.

To utilize, open webpage.
